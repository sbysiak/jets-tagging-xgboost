# Jets tagging with XGBoost

Analysis of possibility of using boosted decision trees (XGBoost implementation) for tagging jets flavour,  
done for my Bachelor thesis:  
"Development of algorithms for identification of jets measured by ALICE experiment using XGBoost",  
written under polish title: "Rozwój algorymów do identyfikacji dżetów cząstek mierzonych przez eksperyment ALICE na LHC"  
under supervision of Jacek Otwinowski, defended at Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science of AGH UST in January 2017.
